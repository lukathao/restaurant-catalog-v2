# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.ts
```
## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
# or for docker
make run
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## gRPC autogenerated code

Do not edit the protobuffer code (*pb.d.ts and pb.js files) directly, instead edit the the proto file to generate the needed user interface

```bash
make proto
```



## Deploy on Vercel

```bash
vercel
```
