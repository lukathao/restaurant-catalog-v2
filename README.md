This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
# or for docker
make run
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## gRPC autogenerated code

Do not edit the protobuffer code (*pb.d.ts and pb.js files) directly, instead edit the the proto file to generate the needed user interface

```bash
make proto
```



## Deploy on Vercel

```bash
vercel
```
